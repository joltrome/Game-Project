# Vending Machine Survival

Gray-box core-loop experiment comparing:

1. A compact arena with left/right movement and jumping.
2. An automatically scrolling conveyor with limited repositioning and jumping.

## Scope lock

No daily challenges, leaderboards, ads, cosmetics, accounts, monetization, meta-progression, or extra modes before voluntary restart behavior is observed.

## Current state

**Build:** VM-0.2.0-A  
**Phase:** Prototype A — compact arena  
**Prototype A gameplay evidence:** None yet

The default scene is the smallest mechanically complete compact-arena prototype: a shared VM-0.1.2 `CharacterBody2D` player, a visible overhead vending drop rack, one telegraphed falling-product hazard, immediate collision death, player-triggered restart, a survival timer, and a capped 60-second difficulty ramp. The movement laboratory remains available at `scenes/main.tscn`. The arena has automated coverage but still requires manual evaluation for warning readability, perceived fairness, death clarity, and restart feel.

## Open locally

1. Install Godot 4.x.
2. In Godot Project Manager, choose **Import**.
3. Select this folder's `project.godot`.
4. Open the project and press **F6/F5**.

## Use with Codex

1. Open this repository folder in the ChatGPT desktop app's Codex view, Codex CLI, or the Codex IDE extension.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` before changing code.
3. Open `docs/roadmap.html` in a browser and use **Copy Codex handoff** for a current task brief.
4. Commit after each runnable milestone.

## Next validation task

Play Build VM-0.2.0-A without changing parameters. Check whether every warning identifies its eventual lane, whether collisions and their source are understandable, whether `R` restarts immediately, and whether the 60-second ramp remains readable. Record observations before tuning or adding content.

## Automated movement test

Run the mirrored grounded-reversal scenarios with Godot available on `PATH`:

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-movement-controller-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_movement_controller.gd
```

## Automated arena test

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-arena-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_arena_loop.gd
```

## Cost

No OpenAI API or separately billed paid API is used by this starter project. Cumulative separately billed project cost: **$0.00**.
