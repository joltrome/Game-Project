# Vending Machine Survival

Gray-box core-loop experiment comparing:

1. A compact arena with left/right movement and jumping.
2. An automatically scrolling conveyor with limited repositioning and jumping.

## Scope lock

No daily challenges, leaderboards, ads, cosmetics, accounts, monetization, meta-progression, or extra modes before voluntary restart behavior is observed.

## Current state

**Build:** VM-0.3.0-B

**Phase:** Prototype B — minimum fixed-camera conveyor
**Gameplay evidence:** Prototype B has not yet been manually reviewed

The Prototype B branch defaults to a separate fixed-camera conveyor scene using the unchanged VM-0.1.2 `CharacterBody2D` player. Build VM-0.3.0-B uses single warned drops from one visible source. Falling cans are lethal; valid conveyor landings become solid, non-lethal moving platforms that carry a standing player left and clean up after leaving the playable area. The player-center control band is x=280–760. A deterministic automated run measured first stationary-player obstacle contact at 10.033 seconds. Whether this removes low-decision waiting without creating perceived unfairness remains a hypothesis pending manual review.

Prototype A is frozen on `master` and tag `VM-0.2.3-A-R1`. Its scene remains available at `scenes/prototypes/arena.tscn`.

## Open locally

1. Install Godot 4.x.
2. In Godot Project Manager, choose **Import**.
3. Select this folder's `project.godot`.
4. Open the project and press **F5** for Prototype B.

## Switch prototypes in Godot

- Prototype B: open `scenes/prototypes/conveyor.tscn` and press **F6**, or press **F5** on this branch.
- Prototype A: open `scenes/prototypes/arena.tscn` and press **F6**.
- To switch back to B immediately, select the already open `conveyor.tscn` tab and press **F6** again. This does not edit either scene or require changing branches.

## Use with Codex

1. Open this repository folder in the ChatGPT desktop app's Codex view, Codex CLI, or the Codex IDE extension.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` before changing code.
3. Open `docs/roadmap.html` in a browser and use **Copy Codex handoff** for a current task brief.
4. Commit after each runnable milestone.

## Next validation task

Play Build VM-0.3.0-B without changing parameters. First remain stationary and record when the first moving obstacle requires a response. Check the warning/chute alignment, falling lethality, landed solidity, leftward motion, standing carry, normal jumping, control-band limits, offscreen cleanup, survival timer, death message, and `R` restart. Then compare against the frozen Prototype A scene using **F6**. Do not tune or add paired drops before recording the manual comparison.

## Automated movement test

Run the mirrored grounded-reversal scenarios with Godot available on `PATH`:

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-movement-controller-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_movement_controller.gd
```

## Automated arena test

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-arena-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_arena_loop.gd
```

## Automated landed-can test

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-landed-can-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_landed_can_persistence.gd
```

## Automated pattern test

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-two-can-pattern-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_two_can_patterns.gd
```

## Automated edge-coverage test

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-edge-coverage-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_edge_coverage.gd
```

## Automated conveyor test

```bash
godot --headless --log-file /tmp/vms-conveyor-test.log --path . --script res://tests/test_conveyor_prototype.gd
```
